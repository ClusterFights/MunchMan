## Description

This is a reference implementation of the
[Project Gutenberg MD5
Search](http://clusterfights.com/wiki/index.php?title=Project_Gutenberg_MD5_Search) challange. 
It is a single node, un-optimized, implementation.
It's purposed is to get benchmark data on individual nodes and to 
compare against future cluster implementations.

The basic measure of interest is how many hashes a second over
the Project Gutenberg dataset can be achieved.  This code should
be able to run on any Linux machine (i.e. laptop, Raspberry Pi 3
Model B+, Raspberry Pi Zero etc).
