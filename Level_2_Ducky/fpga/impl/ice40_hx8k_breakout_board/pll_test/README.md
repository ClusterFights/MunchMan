# PLL_TEST

## Description

A test to use a pll to increase the clock rate from
the base 12mhz on the iCE40HX-8K demo board.
The [IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/)
tools install
a command line program called "icepll" that will
generate a verilog module for the pll.

For example the following command generates a verilog
module that takes a 12mhz clock in and generates
a 72mhz clock on the output.

```
$ icepll -i 12 -o 72 -m -f pll_72mhz.v
```
We then edit the code generated by icepll to use global
buffers.
